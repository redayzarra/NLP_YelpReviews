Yelp Reviews Classification

This project covers the topic of natural language processing or NLP to classify 
user-generated text and determine their intent. The goal of this project is to build
a model that can automatically classify Yelp reviews into one of several predefined
categories, such as "positive," "negative," or "neutral." To accomplish this, the 
project uses NLP techniques to process and analyze the text of the reviews.

The model can then be used to predict the label for new, unseen reviews. This can 
be especially useful for businesses, as it can help them identify patterns in 
customer feedback and make improvements to their products or services.

We will start by importing the necessary libraries for natural language processing:
"""
# Importing the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd # Pandas is used for data frame manipulations
import numpy as np # NumPy is a package used for numerical analysis

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
